# The StudyHall Project

## Goal

To create open-source software and an accessible platform that allows people to teach the art of software.

## Current Initiatives

To help better understand the needs of both teachers and students, I ([@zorn](https://github.com/zorn)) am currently doing research and documenting my thoughts at a blog called [Course Dreamers](https://coursedreamers.com/).

In the future, I plan to start building here, under this organization.
